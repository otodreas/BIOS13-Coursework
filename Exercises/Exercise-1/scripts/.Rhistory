#### Exercises basic R course ####
### A. Variables and labels ###
## 1. Create a variable named tigers with the value 10 ##
tigers <- 10
## 2. Create another variable lions with the value tigers + 12 ##
lions <- tigers + 12
## 3. Check that there now are two object called tigers and lions, using ls()
## or objects(). ##
ls()
objects()
## 4. Make sure that lions has the value 22.##
cat("lions = ", lions, "\n") #This will result in printing the value of lions
## 6. Make sure that lions still has the value 22 (and that you understand why). ##
cat("lions = ", lions, "\n") #Same as question 4
## 7. It is possible to name or tag almost anything in R. A name attribute
##can be a longer, more meaningful description of a variable, which may have
## more meaning than the, often short, variable name (such as tigers or lions
## above). It can also be a short description of a column of a data frame.
##The names() function is used to access or change the name attribute of a
## variable. Try the following commands:
names(tigers) <- "The numbers of tigers in this jungle"
print(tigers)
help(names)
names(tigers)
tigers2 <- 2*tigers
tigers2
print(tigers2)
